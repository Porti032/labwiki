## Setting up

## Using the manual motor control

## Cleaning up

- After use, ensure that both the robot and extruder are turned off. For the extruder, please also disconnect the electronics box.
- Always return the LAN cables to their proper place. Do not leave them on the floor, as this poses a tripping hazard and could damage the connectors on the robot or router.
- If you plan to use the extruder consecutively, you may leave it loaded. However, cover the hole to prevent the clay from drying on the auger screw.
- If you will not be using the extruder consecutively, please clean the extruder thoroughly and cover the hose to prevent clay from drying inside.
- Ensure all working surfaces, including the floor around the area, are clean of any clay residue after use.
